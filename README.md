# CNN_in_PyTorch
 A CNN (convolutional neural network, ResNet-50 architecture) for classification of medical images (in python, pytorch) 

 Same Project as here: https://github.com/BitMarkus/CNN_in_Tensorflow
 But instead of Tensorflow it is written in PyToch

Tested under the following environment: NVIDIA RTX 4090 or NVIDIA RTX A5000 (24 GB VRAM), Python: 3.8.19, Pytorch: 2.3.1, CUDA: 12.1
