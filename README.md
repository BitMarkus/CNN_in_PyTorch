# CNN_in_PyTorch
A CNN (convolutional neural network, different architectures) for classification of microscopic images (in python, pytorch) 

Similar project as here: https://github.com/BitMarkus/CNN_in_Tensorflow. But instead of Tensorflow it is written in PyToch.

Tested under the following environment: NVIDIA RTX 4090 or NVIDIA RTX A5000 (24 GB VRAM), Python: 3.8.19, Pytorch: 2.3.1, CUDA: 12.1, cuDNN: 8907
